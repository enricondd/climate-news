# climate_news

This is the Final Project for my course in Data Science at WBS Coding School.

The main question is: "Are we really talking about Climate Change?"

To address it, I am gonna analyze the presence in the news of headlines related to Climate Change.

As Data Sources, I will use:

1. The GDELT Project database - via API and direct datasets (https://api.gdeltproject.org/api/v2/summary/summary?d=iatv)
2. The Guardian database - via API (https://open-platform.theguardian.com/)
3. The Global Carbon Project database - via direct datasets (https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/)
4. Our World in Data database - via direct datasets (https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/climate-change)

As Tools, I will use:

1. Python (several libraries and packages) - mainly for API requests and Data Cleaning
2. Tableau Pro - Data Visualization
3. Google Presentations - presenting the idea and the project to the audience
